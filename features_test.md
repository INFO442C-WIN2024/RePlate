Feature we are testing : add to cart

Comment 1 (teacherâ€™s comment):

Update add to cart button to change state
Removing one item from the cart empties the entire cart
All the data is mock
Check out product issue
Do we really want to take on trying to take on the whole payment process?
Scope down potentially
Coupon features 
Comment 2:
Update the display of the empty cart
Button 
Fix button display on the restaurant page
Comment 3:
Add to cart indicate that item has been added to the cart
Comment 4:
Consider displaying cuisine types over 2 rows to reduce scrolling
Comment 5:
Clicking on marker in map view moves the map and other icons

Our own feedback:
Only allow one cuisine type to be selected at a time
Really work on cart page more
Fix the remove feature
Either removes all the items of the same time or allows to remove only one item of the same type at the time
Reconsider the display for empty cart
Come up with alternative to entering payment information
Really set up the databases to allow for the actual data upload instead of using hard coded mock ups
Hide save stores
Add map links to restaurant pages
Fix dark mode display on the restaurant page
